append() extend()
generator -> yeild
== checks equality and is checks identity(same memory location)
Decorators
lambda function
*args **kwargs
Shallow copy and deep copy[copy.copy() list.copy()| copy.deepcopy()]
set and frozenset (immutable and hashable)
try, except, else and finnaly
global modifies a global variable inside a function
break, continue, pass
zip() - zip([1,2], ['a','b']) yields (1,'a'), (2,'b')

datatypes - int, float, str, list, tuple, dict, set, bool, NoneType
__str__ | __repr__ [user friendly string and dev friendly string for debugging]

with - file handling
map() - applying function to each element in iterable
reduce()
module - python file containing code can be imported
module = single file | package = directory with an __init__.py file
pickling = serializing python objects to a byte stream using pickle module
list.sort() modifies list in place | sorted() returns a new sorted list
Magic methods = __init__() | __str__() || for defining object behaviour

@static method - doesn't access instance or class data
@class method - takes the class as its argument

super() - for accessing methods from parent function

Context Manager - handles resource setup and cleanup | Used with the "with" statement

collections module:
provides specialized container datatypes like namedtyple, deque, counter

difference between __init__ and __new__
__new__ creates new instance AND __init__ is constructor

itertools?
tools for efficient ierations like permutations, combinations and chain

docstring
string literal used to document modules, classes or functions enclosed in triple quotes

enumerate()
provides index and value pairs from an iterable

asyncio module
for asyn programming with coroutines, event loops and tasks

metaclass
class controlling class createionxl

functools module
provides tools for working with functions like partial, reduce and lru_cache

__getattr__ and __getattribute__
undefined attributes and attribute accesses
